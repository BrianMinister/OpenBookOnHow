This letter is addressed to those people who have proven that privatized solutions outperform, while managing cost, the public-sector options.

You are the people that change the world by proving that you do your best without burdening society with more government interaction. We want you to tell your story. We are looking for more people to inspire the masses to think outside of the box, away from government solutions, and start thinking along the way of how can I improve things as a business, or charity.

This first book is planned to focus on inspiring people to develop their own solutions, and promote their own fixes to the shortcoming of government solutions. To do this, we have picked the top items in every debate, such as Roads, Healthcare, Education, and more. We are looking at applying real proven private sector solutions to what government is currently offering.

We believe that this is the first of many books like this, and we do expect our contributors to market their company as part of their contribution to the book. I wouldn't expect you to contribute to the book, if I didn't expect your company to directly benefit. No person should be expected to work without benefiting themselves. This does not mean that I am planning on publishing this at a profit, I am withholding that decision until I hear from the contributors.

Publishing plans will be to run this out through Amazon Kindle, and Amazon Print on Demand services. If we do get a cash sponsor, then we will lower our cost by printing this in volume and make it available at a substantially reduced price.

How you get compensated will be up to you and the group of other contributors. If everyone is good with the free marketing that this book will provide, then I an highly responsible to make sure that this book reaches maximum exposure, so that you can expect to be called for paid speaking engagements and more calls for your services.

If you expect to be paid for your material, then we can work out a royalties program. The goal of this book is to open mental doors to reduce government dependency, and hence tax burden. If we can get this book out to everyone at cost, then we will reach a larger audience, and hence more people will learn of your services. Don't let that stop you if you really believe that you need to be directly compensated.

I am composing this book so that we can undo generations of loss of creative problem solving. We are now in a time where several people cannot imagine a world without government involved in every little aspect of life. I find this both disturbing and counterproductive. If a person believes that a safe road needs government's blessing, then how will they every plan for their own commercial park, without planning on government interference on each and every step. We are already seeing this interference with our healthcare, which is why I am excited to hear about subscription based private healthcare, and surgical parks.  

I am also excited to hear about the revival of the private fire and police departments. I say revival, because for the longest time, these were private or voluntary from the public.

This is an exciting time to live in. It is a time where government is trying to create overreach, but at the same time people are overcoming the problems that more government is creating.

Please join me in opening the mental gateways, so that we can usher in a bright future where business owners are the heroes, and not the politicians.

Sincerely,<br/>
Brian Webb<br/>
Director Book Development<br/>
