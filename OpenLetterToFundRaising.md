To potential investors,

If, like me, you value liberty over security, you value solutions to daily challenges without coercion, you value keeping your wages, over being treated as property of the state, then this is the project for you.

Though pre-orders, donations, and sales of advertisers space, we are funding the authoring, editing, and distributions of the next book on how to replace government solutions with private sector solutions.

This book is fully inspired by some of the best minds in liberty, and by those who are currently applying those principles. With that in mind, the content of this book will document strong existing, and successful, examples of replacing government solutions with private sector solutions.

We are doing this because it appears that through generations of government involvement in society, people have forgotten that for most of history, government never did as much as it is now. The modern socialist society is a modern weed in the history of the ingenuity of human exceptionalism.

Sure, we have always had socialism, or communism, even other totalitarianisms, but even the older regimes did not get as personally involved with people as the last 70 years of invasive government has. It is time to reverse that personal invasion, and restore personal liberty.

Please join me, and see how you can help make this project a success.

Your fellow liberty loving neighbor,<br/>
